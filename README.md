VEGIEHAT: Empowering Communities for Fairer Markets

# Why VEGIEHAT?
In Bangladesh, unpredictable food prices often create challenges for families trying to make ends meet. Factors like natural disasters, market manipulation, and global supply chain disruptions contribute to these fluctuations. Our mission with VEGIEHAT is to empower communities by providing them with the tools to monitor and report market prices collectively. By doing so, we aim to foster accountability and ensure everyone has access to essential goods at fair prices.

# How Does VEGIEHAT Work?
VEGIEHAT leverages crowd-sourced data from individuals across the country. With our app, users can easily report real-time market prices, creating a transparent pricing environment. This data is then analysed and shared openly, promoting fairness and enabling consumers to make informed decisions. Our approach is guided by inclusivity, accuracy, and community engagementâ€”values that ensure the platform truly serves the people.

# What is VEGIEHAT?
